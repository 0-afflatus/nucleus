Nucleus

Design Specification

1. A minimal bare-bones modding base on which to build games.
2. Aim for compatibility with MTG mods, so a playable experience similar to MTG may be achieved by installing the same mods.
3. Add more detailed code comments, particularly in areas likely to need customsation.
4. Create user documentation in HTML and other formats that goes into enough detail to get users started building their own games.
5. Every single game-world element must be easy to customise.
6. Develop a sane naming scheme and mod / folder / namespace hierarchy.

The 'base' mod should be as minimal as possible. It is mostly concerned with providing the player UI.

I decided to include example mods to provide minimal flora and tools, for example. I have included an element mod, which provides the basic rock, dirt, grass and mapgen biomes that used to be in default. Each of these example mods must be self-contained with minimal dependencies, follow a sane naming scheme and be equally well documented as the core. These could include easy-to-modify APIs. Each and every game-world specific element must be easy to disable, either by removing its folder or disabling it via a setting.

Because reasons

Nucleus isn't a game, it's a 4D multiplayer voxel modelling environment in which building games is one of many possibilities. It is not intended to be used as a stand-alone application, but as a base for creating more fully featured 4D-MVMEs or games.

Nucleus lacks challenges or goals deliberately in order to facilitate open-ended exploration and experimentation.
